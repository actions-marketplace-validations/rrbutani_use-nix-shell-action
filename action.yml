    # Point to the vendored `nix-direnv`'s script.

    # We would grab this from `cache.nixos.org` (by store path, for
    # reproducibility) but doing so presents several challenges:
    #   - `nix-direnv` depends on `nix`, etc so it has a large-ish closure size
    #     even though we only really want one function from it
    #   - the derivations technically are system specific (since some of the
    #     deps are) so we'd want to maintain a matrix of store paths here for
    #     the different runner platforms ((linux, macos) x (arch)) so that we
    #     pick the store path that will result in the fewest extra things being
    #     downloaded to the store (it technically doesn't matter if we pull the
    #     "wrong" `nix-direnv` for a platform since we're not actually executing
    #     it; it's just annoying because we'd be pulling in a bunch of binaries
    #     and deps too)
    #
    # So, to keep things fast and simple we just vendored the `nix-direnv`
    # envrc script.
